Working title - Project Crossbow!

Descrition:
The application allows the user to view the locations and information about active food establishments and display any licensing data available if the establishment has a liquor license. User can move the sliders on page to see the number of restaurants that were issued licenses in that particular range.

Setup:
Since some browsers do not allow cross-domain request, I recommend on setting up a localhost and run the index.html after downloading the files.


Dataset:
